require_relative "./path.rb" # Code your solution here.

# Code some tests for path.rb.

# There are three methods.

# The normalize_path method will return an absolute
# path to the file no matter what kind of path sent
# to it.

# The absolute_path? method will return true if the
# path passed to it is absolute.

# The relative_path? method will return true if the 
# path passed to it is relative.

# Write some test that spec it out.

# Use the other tests in this suite to complete this.

# You should should write at least three describe blocks, 
# one for each method.

# Test the negative and positive results, for example,
# when describing absolute_path? make sure to test
# the results when sent a relative and absolute path.
