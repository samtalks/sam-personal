# # Triangle
 
# Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
 
# As a bonus, the program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.
 
# ## Hint
 
# The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle inequality_.
