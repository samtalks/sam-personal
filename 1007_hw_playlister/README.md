**Part 1**

Fork this repository, clone it to your computer, and make the rspec tests pass.

1) Create a Class for song, artist, and genre. Use an individual file for each class.
These files should be placed within a lib directory.

2) Implement the code that makes all of the RSpec specs in the spec directory pass. Don't forget to include any necessary files.

3) Implement the pending tests and make them pass.
  
To run all tests, type `rspec spec.rb` from the project root directory.
